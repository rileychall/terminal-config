I recommend cloning this into `~/config/` and adding this line to your actual `.bashrc` file:

``` plaintext
source $HOME/config/.bashrc
```

This will make it easy to separate your own customization from this and completely remove this stuff if you want. (Also the `.bashrc` as-is assumes that the `.vimrc` is in `~/config/`)
